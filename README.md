# FLAVORA - A Healthy, fast and flavorous option. (Shopping Cart Project)

This website was created as part of the The Odin Project's Shopping Cart project, in which we had to create a simple shopping app with a item list and shopping cart functionality, while implementing at least two Route components.

It was built with Javascript, HTML and CSS.

React was utilized as front-end framework.

Jest was utilized as testing framework.

The food recipes and pictures were taken from Eating Well website.
